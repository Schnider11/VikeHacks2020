<!--
So I'm not sure if we need an extension page for anything...

Not necessarily much to configure at this point. Maybe longer term if this extension was continued on.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      button {
        height: 30px;
        width: 30px;
        outline: none;
        margin: 10px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="buttonDiv"></div>
    <div>
      <p>Choose a different background color!</p>
    </div>
  </body>
  <script src="options.js"></script>
</html>
